🌍ImpactHub<br>
🚀 Bridging NGOs & Students Through Technology

Impact Hub is a platform that connects NGOs facing real-world social challenges with students capable of building technology-driven solutions.

Many NGOs still rely on traditional paperwork and outdated systems. Impact Hub provides a digital bridge where NGOs can post their problems, and students can contribute innovative tech-based solutions. If a student's solution is successfully implemented, the NGO can issue a blockchain-verified certificate as recognition.

🏆 Hackathon Project<br>
📍 Built during our first hackathon<br>
🗓 7th Feb – 9th Feb 2026<br>

⚙ How to Run Locally<br>
Follow the steps below to run the ImpactHub project on your system.

---

## 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Madhav1303/ImpactHub.git
cd ImpactHub
```

---

## 2️⃣ Backend Setup (Flask)

### Step 1: Go to Backend Folder

```bash<br>
cd BACKEND
```

---

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

#### ▶ On Windows
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```


### Step 3: Install Required Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not present, install manually:

```bash
pip install flask flask-cors
```

(Add other dependencies if required.)

---

### Step 4: Run the Backend Server

```bash
python main.py
```

After running this, you should see something like:

```
Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

Your backend API is now running locally.

---

## 3️⃣ Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal (keep backend running).

Go back to project root:

```bash
cd ..
```

Then go to frontend folder (if exists):

```bash
cd FRONTEND
```

---

### Option 1 (Recommended): Use VS Code Live Server

1. Open the FRONTEND folder in VS Code.
2. Right click on `index.html`
3. Click **Open with Live Server**

---

### Option 2: Open Directly in Browser

Simply double click:

```
index.html
```

---

## 4️⃣ Verify Everything Works

- Backend running at:
  ```
  http://127.0.0.1:5000/
  ```

- Frontend should load in browser.
- Make sure API URLs in JS files match:
  ```
  http://127.0.0.1:5000/
  ```

---

## ⚠ Important Notes

- Keep backend terminal running while using frontend.
- If you get CORS error, ensure Flask-CORS is installed.
- If using database/blockchain features, configure them before running.
- Make sure Python is installed and added to PATH.

---

🎉 That's it! ImpactHub should now run locally on your system.
