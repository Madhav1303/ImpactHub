🌍ImpactHub<br>
🚀 Bridging NGOs & Students Through Technology

Impact Hub is a platform that connects NGOs facing real-world social challenges with students capable of building technology-driven solutions.

Many NGOs still rely on traditional paperwork and outdated systems. Impact Hub provides a digital bridge where NGOs can post their problems, and students can contribute innovative tech-based solutions. If a student's solution is successfully implemented, the NGO can issue a blockchain-verified certificate as recognition.
